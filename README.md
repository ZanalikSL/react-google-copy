## Use

## Technical solution

We have three components and a main page.

To make the CSS look as close as possible to the Google site I thought about using the Material-UI, but I ended up changing my mind and using Styled-Components to better represent my CSS styling skills.

I went to the Google page and there I found the colors and icons with Chrome's DevTools.

Structure and organization I decided to keep it simple but with the possibility of scaling.
