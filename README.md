# The google react project
For this project we need you to make the google homepage inside react.
For that you'll need to access [here](https://impartial-primula-42a.notion.site/Google-Test-0694b54f873442309919a2bff1c159ea) the image we want in the end of the project.

We need it to be:
* Fully responsive
* With the same colors as the image (dark theme). Try to use colorpickers for that.
* Full react based

Would be great:
* To commit the changes, so we can see review it well :)
* To use a different branch instead of ``` main ```
* Communicate with your team leader about the project (if needed)

Due date:
* 05/11/2021 23:59 BRT
